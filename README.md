## Run it locally (clean clone → working app in ~5 minutes)

### 0. Prerequisites

- **Node.js 22 LTS** and npm 10+
- **MongoDB 7** running locally, or an Atlas connection string

MongoDB should run as a **single-node replica set** — multi-document transactions
(bookings, payments, payroll) do not work on a standalone `mongod`. It behaves
exactly like standalone otherwise, so set it up now rather than in week 6:

```bash
mongod --replSet rs0 --dbpath /path/to/data
# then once, in mongosh:
rs.initiate()
```

Auth and everything built so far works fine on standalone too, so this will not
block you on day one.

### 1. Backend

```bash
cd backend
cp .env.example .env      # the defaults work as-is for local development
npm install
npm run seed              # creates one demo user per role
npm run dev               # http://localhost:5000
```

### 2. Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
cp .env.example .env
npm install
npm run dev               # http://localhost:3000
```

Open <http://localhost:3000> and sign in.

**If it does not run from a clean clone, say so in the group chat immediately.**
Do not spend hours debugging setup.

## Signing in

Login is **two steps**: email + password, then a 6-digit code.

**You do not need an email account.** In development the code is printed to the
backend log *and* returned in the login response, so the login screen shows it
and fills it in for you. Click **Verify and sign in**.

### Demo accounts

`npm run seed` creates these. Password for all of them: **`Password123!`**

| Email | Role |
|---|---|
| `admin@mediaoctus.test` | Administrator |
| `manager@mediaoctus.test` | Manager |
| `sales@mediaoctus.test` | Sales Agent |
| `ops@mediaoctus.test` | Operations |
| `finance@mediaoctus.test` | Finance |
| `hr@mediaoctus.test` | HR |
| `employee@mediaoctus.test` | Employee |

Sign in as at least two of these when testing your module — that is how you find
out whether your permissions are actually enforced. It is on the Definition of Done.

To reset their passwords back to the default: `npm run seed -- --reset-passwords`.

## Scripts

**Backend** (`cd backend`)

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Dev server with reload |
| `npm run seed` | Create the demo users |
| `npm test` | Run tests |
| `npm run typecheck` | TypeScript, no emit |
| `npm run lint` | ESLint (also enforces the no-cross-module-import rule) |
| `npm run format` | Prettier over `src/` |
| `npm run build` / `npm start` | Compile to `dist/` and run it |

**Frontend** (`cd frontend`)

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Dev server |
| `npm run build` / `npm start` | Production build and serve |
| `npm run typecheck` | TypeScript, no emit |
| `npm run lint` | ESLint |
| `npm run format` | Prettier over `src/` |

**Both at once** (`cd code`)

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `npm install` | Installs the pre-commit hook and Prettier |
| `npm run check` | Typecheck + lint + tests across both apps |
| `npm run format` | Prettier over both apps |

A pre-commit hook formats staged files, so no review is ever about whitespace.
It activates once the repo exists — run `npm install` in `code/` after `git init`.

## Auth API

| Method | Path | Who | What |
|---|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/api/auth/login` | public | Step 1 — email + password, returns a `challengeId` |
| `POST` | `/api/auth/verify-otp` | public | Step 2 — `challengeId` + `code`, returns the session |
| `POST` | `/api/auth/resend-otp` | public | New code for an existing challenge (30s cooldown) |
| `POST` | `/api/auth/refresh` | public | Rotates the refresh token, returns a new access token |
| `POST` | `/api/auth/logout` | authenticated | Revokes this device's refresh token |
| `GET` | `/api/auth/me` | authenticated | The current user and their permission list |
| `POST` | `/api/auth/register` | `users.create` | Creates a user — admin only, not self-signup |
| `GET` | `/api/health` | public | Liveness check |

### Employees (G1 — the reference module)

| Method | Path | Permission |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/api/employees` | `employees.view` — paged, filtered, searchable |
| `GET` | `/api/employees/me` | `employees.self` — every role has this |
| `GET` | `/api/employees/manager-options` | `employees.view` |
| `GET` | `/api/employees/:id` | `employees.view` |
| `GET` | `/api/employees/:id/reports` | `employees.view` — direct reports |
| `POST` | `/api/employees` | `employees.manage` |
| `PATCH` | `/api/employees/:id` | `employees.manage` |
| `DELETE` | `/api/employees/:id` | `employees.manage` — soft delete |

PAN, Aadhaar, bank details and CTC are returned only to roles holding
`employees.sensitive` (Admin, HR, Finance). They are stripped in the service
layer, so they are absent from the JSON rather than hidden in the UI. Sign in as
HR and then as Manager and compare `/employees` — that is the check the
Definition of Done is asking for.

### Other core endpoints

| Method | Path | Who |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/api/notifications` | authenticated — own notifications only |
| `POST` | `/api/notifications/:id/read` | authenticated — own only |
| `POST` | `/api/notifications/read-all` | authenticated |
| `GET` | `/api/files/*` | authenticated — dev storage adapter only |

Access tokens last 15 minutes; the API client refreshes them automatically.
Refresh tokens last 7 days, are stored hashed, and rotate on every use.

Errors always come back as:

```json
{ "error": { "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR", "message": "…", "details": [ { "field": "email", "message": "…" } ] } }
```

## OTP in development vs production

Controlled entirely by environment variables — see `backend/.env.example`.

| Variable | Dev | Production |
|---|---|---|
| `OTP_DELIVERY` | `console` — the code is printed to the server log | `email` |
| `OTP_EXPOSE_IN_RESPONSE` | `true` — the login screen shows and pre-fills the code | ignored; **force-disabled** when `NODE_ENV=production` |

### Switching on real email MFA later

Nothing in the auth service or the UI has to change:

1. Get the client's email provider account (Resend / SES / Postmark) with domain
   verification. **Not VPS SMTP** — OTP mail lands in spam and blocks logins entirely.
2. Implement `emailTransport.send()` in `backend/src/core/notifications/transports.ts`.
3. Set `OTP_DELIVERY=email` plus `EMAIL_PROVIDER` / `EMAIL_API_KEY` / `EMAIL_FROM`.

The `devOtp` field simply stops being returned, and the dev-mode panel on the
login screen disappears on its own.
